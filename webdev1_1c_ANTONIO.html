            What is Melatonin?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Melatonin is the natural hormone your body secretes that helps to maintain your wake-sleep cycle (also called “biological clock”). Melatonin is also made synthetically and available without a prescription as an over-the-counter (OTC) dietary supplement in the U.S.
            <br />
            <br />
            Melatonin is most commonly used to:
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    help decrease jet lag
                </li>
                <li>
                    adjust sleep cycles in the blind (non 24-Hour Sleep Wake Disorder, or Non-24)
                </li>
                <li>
                    treat shift-work sleep disorders in people with alternating work schedules
                </li>
                <li>
                    for general insomnias
                </li>
            </ul>
            The wake-sleep cycle is the process of sleep and wakefulness; in humans this averages 8 hours of nighttime sleep and 16 hours of daytime activity.
            <br />
            <br />
            Supplemental Melatonin has been suggested to have many uses, from sleep disorders to cancer treatment, but adequate studies are lacking for many uses. It has been widely studied for treatment of jet lag and other sleep disorders.
            <br />
            <br />
            Endogenous melatonin release (made by our bodies) is increased each day in response to darkness, peaking between 11PM and 3AM at roughly 200 picograms (pg) per mL. Nighttime levels are roughly 10 times higher than in the daytime. Levels fall sharply before daylight, and are barely detectable in the daylight hours. The rise and fall in endogenous levels signal wake and sleep times, known as our circadian rhythm.
            <br />
            <br />
            Natural melatonin production starts from the amino acid tryptophan, with serotonin as an intermediary, and then is released to the receptors in the brain, eye and other areas to help control the sleep quality and wake cycles. The half-life is short, roughly 20 to 50 minutes. It is metabolized (broken down) by the CYP450 enzyme system in the liver and then excreted in the urine or feces.
            <br />
            <br />
            Shorter periods of production occur in the summer with longer days, and more prolonged periods of production occur in the winter. Light at night (such as from smartphones or the TV) blocks production and can lead to sleep disturbances. Age also suppresses the levels of nighttime melatonin that are released, which may contribute to the problem of insomnia and early awakening often seen in older adults.

            What is Melatonin used for?        
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>            
                Trouble falling asleep at a conventional bedtime (delayed sleep phase syndrome). Taking melatonin by mouth seems to shorten the time needed to fall asleep in young adults and children with this condition.
            </li>
            <li>            
                Non-24-hour sleep wake disorder. Taking melatonin by mouth at bedtime seems to improve sleep in children and adults who are blind.
            </li>
        </ul>

            Who should not take Melatonin?        
        </h2>
        <p>

            What are the side effects of Melatonin?        
        </h2>
        <p>
            Melatonin is a relatively safe supplement when used in the short-term, and melatonin side effects are uncommon. Its safety in the long-term has not been determined in randomized, controlled studies. In general this medication appears to be relatively nontoxic, even at higher doses such as 3 to 5 mg once a day.
            <h3>Serious side effects of Melatonin include</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    daytime drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, or confusion
                </li>
                <li>
                    vivid dreams, nightmares
                </li>
                <li>
                    feeling depressed, anxious, irritable
                </li>
                <li>
                    headache            
                </li>
                <li>
                    loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain
                </li>
                <li>
                    blood pressure changes
                </li>
                <li>
                    joint or back pain
                </li>
                <li>
                    elevated risk for seizures
                </li>
            </ol>
            Higher external doses(>1 mg to 10 mg) can worsen side effects like daytime drowsiness, impaired physical or mental ability, low body temperature, and elevated prolactin levels.

            Storage         
        </h2>
        <ol reversed type="I">
            <li>
                Store melatonin out of reach and sight of children.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep medicines and supplements in a cool, dry place. This helps prevent them from becoming less effective before they expire.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don’t store them in bathrooms, which are often hot and humid.            
            </li>
        </ol>
